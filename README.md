# Kaggle-Titanic-Spaceship

This project is a part of the Kaggle Competition. The story behind this dataset is that, it is  year 2912 where our data science skills are required to supoort the mission in space to solve the cosmic mystery. Currently we have with us a transmission from four light years away and thing's are not looking favorable. 

Spaceship Description: Titanic Spaceship is an interstellar passenger liner launched a month ago. The capacity of the space rover is 13000 space on board. The vessel set out on its maiden voyage transporting emigrants from our solar system to three newly habitable exoplanets orbiting nearby stars.

While rounding Alpha Centauri en route to its first destination—the torrid 55 Cancri E—the unwary Spaceship Titanic collided with a spacetime anomaly hidden within a dust cloud. Sadly, it met a similar fate as its namesake from 1000 years before. Though the ship stayed intact, almost half of the passengers were transported to an alternate dimension!

To help rescue crews and retrieve the lost passengers, you are challenged to predict which passengers were transported by the anomaly using records recovered from the spaceship’s damaged computer system.

Help save them and change history!
